I'm a enthusiastic developer, primarily interested in working with backend web and software development. My talents range from full stack web development, both with and without modern frameworks, to software development in C# and .NET, and even some machine learning.

The project I'm the most proud of at this moment in time is my Honors Project, where I compared the efficiency of traditional machine learning models with medical data used to determine if a patient has alzheimers or dementia. The project covered the literature in the field along with coverage on important features and multiple tests to see how the model would perform with and without an important feature.
