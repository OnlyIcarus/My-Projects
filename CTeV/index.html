                <p><b>What is CTEV?</b>
                </p>
    
                <p> Congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV), also known as clubfoot, is one of the most common congenital orthopaedic conditions affecting 1-5: 1,000. <br><br>

                    Between 150,000 and 200,000 babies are born with CTEV worldwide each year. <br><br>
                </p>

                <p>  
                    Around 80% of children born with CTEV live in low or middle income countries. <br>
                    The condition is characterised by one or both feet being turned in and positioned in towards the midline, rather than straight ahead (equinovarus). In a small percentage of cases CTEV can be associated with a range of related conditions (co-morbidities) such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida or developmental dysphasia of the hip (DDH). <br><br>
                    
                    Despite many excellent programs and initiatives to treat CTEV in Low to Mid Income Countries (LMIC), there are a significant percentage of the 120,000-160,000 babies who remain untreated due to limited access to care or lack of financial resources. <br><br>
                    
                    CTEV can have a significant impact on quality of life both for the child and for their families. For the child, in addition to a lifetime of pain and poor function, in LMICs, access to education and employment can be limited due to marginalisation by their families and social groups. <br><br> 
                    
                    
                    Although CTEV deformity is now largely successfully treated in developed countries, over the next 10 years, 2 million adults will be living with crippling CTEV deformities throughout the world (Mayo 2015).  The need for successful clinical and educational programs cannot be overstated.
